# **Reimbursement Tracking System – Use Case Documentation**

### **Purpose**
This document describes the key **use cases** for the **Reimbursement Tracking System**.  
The goal is to simplify and digitize the organization’s reimbursement process by replacing manual Google Forms and emails with a transparent, efficient, and centralized digital system.

## **Business Overview**
Currently, employees submit travel or work-related reimbursement claims manually using forms or spreadsheets.  
This process is slow, error-prone, and lacks visibility for both employees and administrators.

#### The **Reimbursement Tracking System** aims to:
- Reduce manual effort and increase operational efficiency.  
- Provide better transparency and accountability.  
- Maintain accurate financial records for audit and reporting.  
- Create a clear approval workflow between employees and admins.  

### **Use Case 1: Employee – Submit Reimbursement**

#### **Actors**
- **Employee** – Staff member submitting a reimbursement request.  
- **System** – The Reimbursement Tracking System that manages reimbursement request and expenses.  
- **Admin** – Reviewer who validates and approves or rejects the reimbursement request.

#### **Goal**
To allow employees to easily create, manage, and submit reimbursement requests for business-related trips or expenses.

#### **Scenario**
1. The employee logs into the system.  
2. Creates a new **reimbursement request** record.  
3. Adds one or more **expenses** under the trip (e.g., travel, accommodation, meals).   
4. Can **edit or delete** expenses anytime before submission.  
5. Once finalized, the employee **submits** the reimbursement request for admin approval.  
6. The system stores the request, updates its status to **Submitted**, and notifies the admin.  

#### **Preconditions**
- The employee must be logged into the system.

3. Selects a trip to review its details, expenses, and uploaded receipts.  
4. Verifies the validity and compliance of expenses.  
5. Approves or rejects the reimbursement request.  
6. The system updates the status to **Approved** or **Rejected** and notifies the employee.
